// TC - O(N+E) + O(E logE) + O(E*4Î±*2)   where N = no. of nodes and E = no. of edges. O(N+E) for extracting edge information from the adjacency list. O(E logE) for sorting the array consists of the edge tuples. Finally, we are using the disjoint set operations inside a loop. The loop will continue to E times. Inside that loop, there are two disjoint set operations like findUPar() and UnionBySize() each taking 4 and so it will result in 4*2. That is why the last term O(E*4*2) is added.

// SC - O(N) + O(N) + O(E) where E = no. of edges and N = no. of nodes. O(E) space is taken by the array that we are using to store the edge information. And in the disjoint set data structure, we are using two N-sized arrays i.e. a parent and a size array (as we are using unionBySize() function otherwise, a rank array of the same size if unionByRank() is used) which result in the first two terms O(N).
